###Objective
Munar One's goal was to to have a close encounter with the Mün, transmitting conservations to Kerbin before becoming the first object to leave the influence of Kerbin.

##Mission Details
Munar One was on course for a low Mün flyby (below 3Km). It's trajectory was corrected so that the launch vehicle could crash into the surface of the Mun for the sake of space-junk.

Before another course correction, scientist decided against the flyby as the craft lacked the power and equipment to be on significant science. After the experiments transmitted, Munar One deliberately crashed into the Mun a few kilometers from the launch vehicle crash site.
