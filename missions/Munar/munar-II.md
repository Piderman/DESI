###Background
How did this mission come about, any unlocks or previous discoveries to warrant it?

###Craft
The same craft from Munar was altered to the probe could be returned to Kerbin with all experiments intact as apposed to transmitting the results.

###Objective
Furthering the progress from the first mission to the Mun, Kerbal scientist were curios if they could get an encounter with the Mun and return any observations to Kerbal for further studies. Four samples were to be taken on the flight: one-third of the distance, two at orbit around the Mun, with the last on the return trip.

##Mission Details
Problems during the upper atmosphere or Kerbin almost sent Munar II back to Kerbin as it dipped into the atmosphere during the circulation burn. Once recovered, the craft made its burn for a high apoapsis around the Mun.

Munar II had a smaller power reserve as it didn't require a transmitter. Engineers however removed too much, estimating the craft to be drained shortly after passing the Mun. In a quick effort to recover the craft, Engineers ditched the last experiment and used the remaining fuel to direct the craft sharply into the atmosphere.

The parachutes were deployed as the craft was detached from its launcher while still in the encounter with the Mun, leaving scientist to hope that the parachutes would still deploy as the craft floated un-powered through space.

Munar II splashed down without any further troubles as the Engineers were hailed heroes for fixing their own mistakes.
