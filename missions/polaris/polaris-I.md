###Background
The first of the <cite>Polaris</cite> missions to greater understand Kerbin and spaceflight was pilot by Jeb, making him the first Kerbal to achieve orbit. The ambitious Kerbal scientists knew little of orbital flight, so naturally they sent up Jeb to simply <q>see what would happen</q>.

###Craft
The primitive Polaris LM was made up of only a Command Pod and parachute, strapped above some fuel and blasted into space with the hope of it not exploding.

###Objective
Polaris I was tasked with completing one orbit of Kerbin and landing at its North Pole as the scientists though the soft snow would slow the craft if the parachute failed. The aim was to understand orbital flight and more importantly, how to land where they wanted.

##Mission Details
Polaris I was not the first vehicle to reach space, but it was the first to successfully complete both an orbit and planned de-orbit. After one rotation of Kerbin (due to limited power) Jeb fired retrograde, detached from the launch vehicle and touched down on the north pole.
