###Background
Polaris III had an identical mission plan and setup to that of Polaris II. 


##Mission Details
A miscalculation in the deorbiting maneuver saw Polaris III splashdown somewhere near the equator. Not only was the landing zone missed, Jeb also forgot to retrieve the experiment results before decoupling them and burning them up in reentry.
