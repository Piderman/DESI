###Craft
Advancements in **Survivability** gave the Polaris Landing Module an minor update by adding landing legs. Due to the sucess of the first mission engineers opted against upgrading the parachute too.


###Objective
The outcome was identical to that of Polaris I, the only change being the expoeriments where to be done on the south pole.

##Mission Details
Somewhere during the accent phase, Polaris II burned almost all of its fuel failing to reach orbit. None of the orbital experiments were carried out as the craft plummitted back to Kerbin shortly after reaching apoapsis of around 75Km.

All was not lost for the mission however, as the craft safely touched down in the north pole with another surface sample was taken for good measure. During the mission debriefing, Jeb argued the mission wasn't a failure as scientist never told him which pole to visit.
