Polaris IV marked the start of Samtop Kermin's first flight in the standard Polaris LM.

###Background
Given the recent two failed outcomes to explore the poles of Kerbin, the program was expand to understand re-entry and landing at a fixed site.

###Objective
Kerbal scientist wanted a better understanding of how to de-orbit and land at a desired location after realising that Polaris I was a fluke. More samples from orbit were required and well as surface samples from the desert.

##Mission Details
This mission was a routine launch into orbit and successful touchdown after two orbits or Kerbin. Samptop completed his first space-walk to gather science after scientist embarrassingly discovered that the previous Polaris samples were never recorded.
