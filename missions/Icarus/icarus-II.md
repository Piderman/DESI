Two rockets, each more identical than the last were launched into <abbr title="Low Kerbal Orbin">LKO</abbr> to mark the first orbital rendezvous of two separate vehichles. 

###Background
A successful first mission and some new tech lead to 

###Craft
A minor adjustment to the Ceres Service Module with the addition of docking ports in exchange 

###Objective
- dock two Ceres SM
- understanding launch timing and orbital rendezvous
- test resources

##Mission Details
The first Ceres SM (M007) reached an orbit of 75,000m and waited for the launch of M008 to dock. M008 was launched almost an orbit later, hoping to reach M007 during circlerisation but was missed-timed.

A few orbits and manouvers later saw the first docking of two orbital vehicles, with plenty of fuel remaining. Bill and Bob swapped stories and snacks, departing shortly after to return to Kebin.
