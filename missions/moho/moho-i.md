### Craft
Moho 1 consistent of a basic Moho CM with the first iteration of the Moho Launch Vehicle which aims to be the first vehicle to reach LKO.

### Objective
The first mission in the Moho series was to understand how to launch a Kerbal high in the atmosphere and safely return him.

Doing so required understanding of how the parachutes and heatshield would function on the command module, as well as finding the limits on the first launcher.

## Mission Details
Concerned with the safety of DESI's first ever rocket launch (manned or otherwise) the staff recalled Moho 1 shortly after rolling it out to the launch pad to setup an abort sequence. Not that it would really matter as Jeb was flying.

Data was sent through the accent to space testing the power consumption of the CM, using almost all of the power during transmission

Ap of 76Km before running out of fuel, Jeb did EVA but had to return as the craft quickly fell back into atmo

tense moment as craft separated but still looked to be on colission course during reentry

craft and LV survived sub-orbital re-entry, around 50% of heat shield survived

Splashdown in ocean, with the exception of the heatshield, Moho CM proved to be a 100% reusable craft.
