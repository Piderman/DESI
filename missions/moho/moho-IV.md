<!-- small intro, delete comment -->

### Background
New tech for probes, electronics and communications

### Payload
Vera was the first satellite launched by DESI. Experiments in electronics meant the first non-manned object could be launched into orbit.

Vera took two goo experiments to gather readings at differing altitudes and send them back to staff at KSC.

### Objective
- test new launch vehicle
- launch first satellite to 100KM
- gather goo readings via radio in LKO

## Mission Details
- Reached target, enough DV to push for 200KM
- while "success", realised we left upper stage in orbit
- satellite will also run out of power and will be stuck in orbit
- satellites don't return enough science
