### Background
Moho 1 lacked the DV to reach orbit so a news launcher was designed using new technology and approaches to building rockets.

Bill's first mission was an ambitious one: reach a stable orbit on an untested vehicle and return safely after three orbits around Kerbin.

### Craft
The new MLV2 was rolled out to push the command module further into space, as well as removal of the command module's heatsheild in an effort to reduce mass.

### Objective
- reach LKO of 75Km
- conduct EVA reports
- test resuablity of to newly designed Moho LV

## Mission Details
The orbital insertion burn didn't go as expected and another was made to ensure the craft didn't fall back into atmosphere.

During the three orbits EVA's and reports were carried out, however the act of sending the data back to KSC drained 90% of the command module's power reserves. Transmittion tests on the far side of the planet had to be cancelled for fear of leaving Bill in orbit.

The command module was pushed to its limmits with the re-entry burn taking place with less than three units of power remaining. Due to the removal of the external heatsheild a more shallow approach to re-entry was taken.

After the CM separated from the upper launch stage, the craft lost all but enought power to deploy the parachutes in an attemp to gain control of the decent. Mission control deciced that due to the lack of power, decent would have to be done uncontrolledusing only the aerodynamic properties of the CM to correctly orrientate the craft.
