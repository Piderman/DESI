## Mission Details

Due to the additional weight of the upper stage the lifting part rather struggled.

The exact objective of the mission was held under tight secrecy, however keen observes noted the final orbit of the craft were consistent to that of a mysterious radio signal recently discovered.

That radio signal closely matched the communications device located on a Kerbalnaught's suit, leading to beliefs a kerbal was stranded in orbit and DESI were testing ways to retrieve him.
