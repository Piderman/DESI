##Use
The Ceres Service Module Mk1 is designed for LKO rendezvous and the return of one Kerbal to Kebin. It consists of two stages: orbital insertion / docking and descent.

Sitting ontop of the Ceres Launcher, the craft can reach an apoapsis of 120km before reaching stable orbit. From there it can meet up other craft or stations.

Once docked, the craft returns to Kerbin's upper atmosphere where it detaches from the insertion stage, leaving it to burn up on re-entry.
